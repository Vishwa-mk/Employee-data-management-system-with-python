# 🧑‍💼 Employee Management System (Python)

This is a **menu-driven Employee Management System** built in Python.  
It helps you manage employees in a simple way — adding, updating, promoting, removing, and even saving them to a file.  

The project also demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** like:
- **Encapsulation** → Storing employee details in one place.  
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism** → Manager and Developer are special types of employees.  
- **File Handling** → All employee data is saved in a JSON file so you don’t lose it after closing the program.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new employees (Manager, Developer, or other roles)  
- Remove employees by ID  
- Update salary or department  
- Promote employees by increasing their salary  
- Search employees by ID or name  
- Display all employees neatly  
- Sort employees by salary or name (ascending/descending)  
- Data is saved in **employees.json** automatically
